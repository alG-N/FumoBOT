# FumoBOT – Complete Overview & Tutorial

FumoBOT is a versatile, feature-rich Discord bot designed to enhance your server experience with fun, economy systems, customization, utilities, and more. This document merges both the feature overview and tutorial commands into one unified reference.

It's one of my first project when I'm still learning on FPT Polytechnic School(although ngl, the school's mid, aside from Java and uh CRUD stuff, and some cool tool we got to know, so I'll still give a credit for that). And yes, this project is **NOT** a graduation project. This is my own project, developed by me, thanks to my homies in Discord telling me to try to make one, although, uh, the bot at the start is not like this, but because of my passion and not wanting to make an easy bot, I decided to go **WILD**.

## 🌟 Features

### 🎉 Fun Commands
The most "Unbalanced" Economy Bot(well, its not that **Unbalanced** I swear), alongside with some new side feature that uh, basically inspired by some other Discord Bot, totally cool!!!

### 💰 Economy System
A deep virtual economy featuring:
- Coins & gems  
- Shops, jobs, quests  
- Collectible fumos & pets  
- Crates, eggs, and gachas  
- Leaderboards  

### ⚙️ Custom Features
Custom settings, modular design, moderation options, and flexible utilities.

### 🌀 Hybrid Design
Fun + utility + economy combined in one bot, I'll usually update it when I got freetime, instead of working for 6 hours in a company and 2.5 hours from school
